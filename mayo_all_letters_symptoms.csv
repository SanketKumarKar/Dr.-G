It may happen when they are bored or while doing a task. For example, people with narcolepsy can suddenly fall asleep while working or talking with friends. It can be especially dangerous to fall asleep while driving. Sleep may last only a few minutes or up to a half-hour. After waking, people with narcolepsy feel refreshed but get sleepy again.; Automatic behaviors. Some people with narcolepsy continue doing a task when they fall asleep briefly. For example, they may fall asleep while writing, typing or driving. They might continue to perform that task while asleep.

They're called hypnopompic hallucinations if they happen upon waking. For example, the person might think they see a stranger in the bedroom who isn't there. These hallucinations may be vivid and frightening because you may not be fully asleep when you begin dreaming.; Changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. REM sleep is when most dreaming happens. Typically, people enter REM sleep 60 to 90 minutes after falling asleep. But people with narcolepsy often move more quickly to REM sleep.

Perimenopause,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/perimenopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20354666,"During perimenopause, you may notice changes in your body. Some changes are subtle and others are more obvious. You might have:; Irregular periods. As ovulation becomes more unpredictable, the time between periods may be longer or shorter, your flow may be light to heavy, and you may skip some periods. If the length of your periods is consistently different by seven days or more, you may be in early perimenopause. If you go 60 days or more between periods, you're likely in late perimenopause. If you go 12 months without a period and then start bleeding, talk to your healthcare professional right away. This could be a sign of a health issue.; Hot flashes. Many people have hot flashes during perimenopause. Hot flashes can vary in how strong they are, how long they last and how often they happen.; Sleep problems. Trouble sleeping is often due to hot flashes or night sweats, but not always. Changes in sleep patterns can happen in perimenopause even without hot flashes or night sweats.; Mood changes. Mood swings, irritability or increased risk of depression may happen during perimenopause. Mood changes can happen for other reasons that are not related to perimenopause. For example, people with a history of hormonal mood changes such as premenstrual syndrome, premenstrual dysmorphic disorder or postpartum depression are more likely to have mood changes during perimenopause. People who have had mood disorders in the past, such as depression or anxiety, are also at risk.; Vaginal and bladder problems. As estrogen levels drop, your vaginal tissues may become drier and less elastic, causing pain during sex. This dryness also can cause burning when you urinate, even if you do not have a urinary tract infection. It also can make you more likely to have urinary or vaginal infections. And you might leak urine more often, need to go more frequently or feel a stronger urge to go.; Decreasing fertility. As ovulation becomes less regular, it's harder to get pregnant. However, if you're having periods, pregnancy is still possible. If you don't want to get pregnant, use birth control until you've gone 12 months without a period.; Changes in sexual function. During perimenopause, sexual arousal and desire may change. Some women may not enjoy sex as much, while others enjoy it more. If you are concerned about your sexual health during or after perimenopause, talk to your healthcare professional.; Loss of bone. As estrogen levels lower, you start to lose bone more quickly than you replace it. This increases your risk of a disease that causes fragile bones, called osteoporosis. People with osteoporosis are at risk of bone breaks.; Changing cholesterol levels. Less estrogen may lead to changes in your blood cholesterol levels. This can include an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, also called the ""bad"" cholesterol, which increases the risk of heart disease. At the same time, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, also called the ""good"" cholesterol, decreases in many women as they age. Together, these changes increase the risk of heart disease."

These nerves regulate all the muscles under your conscious control, such as those used for walking, talking and holding objects. Damage to these nerves can cause muscle weakness, painful cramps and muscle twitching.; Sensory nerves. Because these nerves relay information about touch, temperature and pain, you may experience a variety of symptoms. These include numbness or tingling in the hands or feet. You may have trouble walking, keeping your balance with your eyes closed, fastening buttons, or sensing pain or changes in temperature. Injury of sensory nerves also may cause pain.; Autonomic (aw-tuh-NOM-ik) nerves.

These sensations can spread upward into your legs and arms.; Sharp, jabbing, throbbing or burning pain.; Extreme sensitivity to touch.; Pain during activities that shouldn't cause pain, such as pain in your feet when putting weight on them or when they're under a blanket.; Lack of coordination and falling.; Muscle weakness.; Feeling as if you're wearing gloves or socks when you're not.; Inability to move if motor nerves are affected.; If autonomic nerves are affected, symptoms might include:; Heat intolerance.; Excessive sweating or not being able to sweat.; Bowel, bladder or digestive problems.; Drops in blood pressure, causing dizziness or lightheadedness.; Peripheral neuropathy can affect one nerve, called mononeuropathy. If it affects two or more nerves in different areas, it's called multiple mononeuropathy, and if it affects many nerves, it's called polyneuropathy. Carpal tunnel syndrome is an example of mononeuropathy. Most people with peripheral neuropathy have polyneuropathy."

These tumors grow slowly, so symptoms may develop over weeks or months and get worse over time. Many of the signs and symptoms of pilocytic astrocytoma are caused by increased pressure in the brain or by the tumor pressing on nearby structures.; Children with tumors near the cerebellum or brainstem may show signs earlier because those areas control balance, coordination and vital functions.; Pilocytic astrocytoma symptoms in children usually are not different from pilocytic astrocytoma symptoms in adults.

Your baby might not grow as quickly as expected, and you might have low amniotic fluid or other complications."

In some cases of pleurisy, fluid builds up in the small space between the two layers of tissue. This is called pleural effusion. When there is a fair amount of fluid, pleuritic pain lessens or disappears because the two layers of pleura are no longer in contact and don't rub together.; Atelectasis. A large amount of fluid in the pleural space can create pressure. This can compress your lung to the point that it partially or completely collapses (atelectasis). This makes breathing difficult and might cause coughing.; Empyema. The extra fluid in the pleural space can also become infected, resulting in a buildup of pus. This is called an empyema. Fever often occurs along with an empyema."

But some captured germs may still survive and multiply.; Most people don't have symptoms during a primary infection. Some people may get flu-like symptoms, such as:; Low fever.; Tiredness.; Cough.; Latent TB infection. Primary infection is usually followed by the stage called latent TB infection. Immune system cells build a wall around lung tissue with TB germs. The germs can't do any more harm if the immune system keeps them under control. But the germs survive. There are no symptoms during latent TB infection.; Active TB disease. Active TB disease happens when the immune system can't control an infection. Germs cause disease throughout the lungs or other parts of the body. Active TB disease may happen right after primary infection.
